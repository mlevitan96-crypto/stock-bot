# Cursor Rules for Stock-Bot Governance

## Core Principles
- Instrumentation before optimization.
- No forward-looking bias in any replay or backtest.
- Live changes require promotion from Paper or Shadow.
- Shadow is allowed to be ugly; Live is not.

## Strategy & Mode Governance
- Treat LIVE, PAPER, SHADOW as separate institutions.
- Never blend metrics across modes.
- Wheel and Equity are sovereign strategies.

## Exit Research
- Exit attribution must include mode, strategy, entry_ts, entry_price, qty, symbol.
- Hold-time and churn analysis take precedence over win rate.
- Longer holds must be evaluated empirically before promotion.

## Safety Rails
- Never assume missing data; fail loudly instead.
- Do not hallucinate prices or timestamps.
- Prefer additive, reversible changes.

## Workflow
- Update MEMORY_BANK.md for any governance change.
- Commit and push before deploying to droplet.
- Produce artifacts for every analytical run.
