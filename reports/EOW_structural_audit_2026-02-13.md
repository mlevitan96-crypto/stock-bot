## 1. Alpha Decay Curves

P&L evolution over position lifetime to identify optimal hold times:

| Hold Time (min) | Avg P&L % | Median P&L % | Win Rate | Sample Count |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 0-30 | -1.99% | 0.00% | 14.99% | 1995 |
| 30-60 | -10.40% | 16.13% | 55.56% | 9 |
| 60-90 | -60.12% | -60.12% | 0.00% | 1 |
| 90-120 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 120-180 | -9.34% | -11.20% | 30.00% | 10 |
| 180-240 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 240+ | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |

**Peak Alpha:** 0-30 (-1.99%)
**Stale Exit Point:** 0-30

## 2. Stealth Flow Effectiveness

**Target:** 100% win rate for Low Magnitude Flow (flow_conv < 0.3)

| Metric | Stealth Flow | Other Flow | Advantage |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Trades | 10 | 2005 | - |
| Win Rate | 30.00% | 15.16% | +14.84pp |
| Avg P&L % | -9.34% | -2.06% | -7.28pp |

**Meets Target (100% win rate):** ❌ NO

## 3. Temporal Liquidity Gate Impact

**Gate Threshold:** 50.0 bps
**Trades Blocked:** 0
**Executed Trades (Liquidity Stats):**
- Sample Count: 0
- Avg Spread: 0.00 bps
- Avg P&L: 0.00%
- Win Rate: 0.00%

## 4. Greeks Decay Analysis (CEX/VEX)

**Gamma-Related Trades:** 2005
**Avg P&L:** -2.06%
**Avg Hold Time:** 1.4 minutes

*Note:* Full CEX/VEX analysis requires integration with structural_intelligence.structural_exit module

---

## 5. Capacity Efficiency

**Displacement Successful:** 0
**Displacement Failed:** 0
**Max Positions Blocked:** 1826
**Total Trades Saved by Displacement:** 0
**Capacity Efficiency:** 0.00%

**Analysis:** Displacement saved 0 trades that would have been blocked by capacity limits

---

## 6. Opportunity Cost Analysis

**High-Score Blocked Trades (>= 5.0):** 2
**Avg Score (Blocked):** 5.17
**Avg P&L (Executed):** -2.10%

**Blocking Reasons (High-Score):**

- displacement_blocked: 2

*Note:* Full opportunity cost requires counterfactual price simulation (see counterfactual_analyzer.py)

---

## Recommendations

Based on this week's analysis:

1. **Alpha Decay:** Peak alpha at 0-30 - consider tightening exits

2. **Stealth Flow:** ❌ Not meeting target (30.00%) - review boost logic

3. **Liquidity Gate:** No liquidity blocks - gate threshold appropriate

4. **Capacity:** No displacement activity - capacity not constrained
