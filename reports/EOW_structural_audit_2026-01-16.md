## 1. Alpha Decay Curves

P&L evolution over position lifetime to identify optimal hold times:

| Hold Time (min) | Avg P&L % | Median P&L % | Win Rate | Sample Count |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 0-30 | -0.98% | 0.00% | 4.90% | 734 |
| 30-60 | 0.63% | -1.62% | 41.67% | 12 |
| 60-90 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 90-120 | -17.23% | -23.71% | 38.30% | 47 |
| 120-180 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 180-240 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 240+ | -16.34% | -8.31% | 45.00% | 20 |

**Peak Alpha:** 30-60 (0.63%)
**Stale Exit Point:** 0-30

## 2. Stealth Flow Effectiveness

**Target:** 100% win rate for Low Magnitude Flow (flow_conv < 0.3)

| Metric | Stealth Flow | Other Flow | Advantage |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Trades | 20 | 793 | - |
| Win Rate | 30.00% | 7.82% | +22.18pp |
| Avg P&L % | -21.23% | -1.79% | -19.44pp |

**Meets Target (100% win rate):** ❌ NO

## 3. Temporal Liquidity Gate Impact

**Gate Threshold:** 50.0 bps
**Trades Blocked:** 0
**Executed Trades (Liquidity Stats):**
- Sample Count: 0
- Avg Spread: 0.00 bps
- Avg P&L: 0.00%
- Win Rate: 0.00%

## 4. Greeks Decay Analysis (CEX/VEX)

**Gamma-Related Trades:** 793
**Avg P&L:** -1.79%
**Avg Hold Time:** 38.5 minutes

*Note:* Full CEX/VEX analysis requires integration with structural_intelligence.structural_exit module

## 5. Capacity Efficiency

**Displacement Successful:** 0
**Displacement Failed:** 0
**Max Positions Blocked:** 1206
**Total Trades Saved by Displacement:** 0
**Capacity Efficiency:** 0.00%

**Analysis:** Displacement saved 0 trades that would have been blocked by capacity limits

---

## 6. Opportunity Cost Analysis

**High-Score Blocked Trades (>= 5.0):** 137
**Avg Score (Blocked):** 5.24
**Avg P&L (Executed):** -2.27%

**Blocking Reasons (High-Score):**

- order_validation_failed: 39
- max_new_positions_per_cycle: 97
- symbol_on_cooldown: 1

*Note:* Full opportunity cost requires counterfactual price simulation (see counterfactual_analyzer.py)

## Recommendations

Based on this week's analysis:

1. **Alpha Decay:** Peak alpha at 30-60 - consider tightening exits

2. **Stealth Flow:** ❌ Not meeting target (30.00%) - review boost logic

3. **Liquidity Gate:** No liquidity blocks - gate threshold appropriate

4. **Capacity:** No displacement activity - capacity not constrained
