## 1. Alpha Decay Curves

P&L evolution over position lifetime to identify optimal hold times:

| Hold Time (min) | Avg P&L % | Median P&L % | Win Rate | Sample Count |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 0-30 | -1.40% | 0.00% | 15.16% | 2012 |
| 30-60 | -14.47% | -8.85% | 16.67% | 12 |
| 60-90 | 9.16% | 19.79% | 66.67% | 3 |
| 90-120 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 120-180 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 180-240 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 240+ | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |

**Peak Alpha:** 60-90 (9.16%)
**Stale Exit Point:** 0-30

## 2. Stealth Flow Effectiveness

**Target:** 100% win rate for Low Magnitude Flow (flow_conv < 0.3)

| Metric | Stealth Flow | Other Flow | Advantage |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Trades | 14 | 2013 | - |
| Win Rate | 35.71% | 15.10% | +20.61pp |
| Avg P&L % | -6.68% | -1.42% | -5.26pp |

**Meets Target (100% win rate):** ❌ NO

## 3. Temporal Liquidity Gate Impact

**Gate Threshold:** 50.0 bps
**Trades Blocked:** 0
**Executed Trades (Liquidity Stats):**
- Sample Count: 0
- Avg Spread: 0.00 bps
- Avg P&L: 0.00%
- Win Rate: 0.00%

## 4. Greeks Decay Analysis (CEX/VEX)

**Gamma-Related Trades:** 2013
**Avg P&L:** -1.42%
**Avg Hold Time:** 1.4 minutes

*Note:* Full CEX/VEX analysis requires integration with structural_intelligence.structural_exit module

---

## 5. Capacity Efficiency

**Displacement Successful:** 0
**Displacement Failed:** 28
**Max Positions Blocked:** 3582
**Total Trades Saved by Displacement:** 0
**Capacity Efficiency:** 0.00%

**Analysis:** Displacement saved 0 trades that would have been blocked by capacity limits

---

## 6. Opportunity Cost Analysis

**High-Score Blocked Trades (>= 5.0):** 3
**Avg Score (Blocked):** 5.02
**Avg P&L (Executed):** -1.46%

**Blocking Reasons (High-Score):**

- max_new_positions_per_cycle: 2
- order_validation_failed: 1

*Note:* Full opportunity cost requires counterfactual price simulation (see counterfactual_analyzer.py)

## Recommendations

Based on this week's analysis:

1. **Alpha Decay:** Peak alpha at 60-90 - consider tightening exits

2. **Stealth Flow:** ❌ Not meeting target (35.71%) - review boost logic

3. **Liquidity Gate:** No liquidity blocks - gate threshold appropriate

4. **Capacity:** No displacement activity - capacity not constrained
