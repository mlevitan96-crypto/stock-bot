## 1. Alpha Decay Curves

P&L evolution over position lifetime to identify optimal hold times:

| Hold Time (min) | Avg P&L % | Median P&L % | Win Rate | Sample Count |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 0-30 | -0.02% | 0.00% | 0.12% | 2452 |
| 30-60 | -5.55% | 11.53% | 50.00% | 4 |
| 60-90 | 61.08% | 61.08% | 100.00% | 1 |
| 90-120 | -2.75% | -2.41% | 35.00% | 20 |
| 120-180 | -123.77% | -104.36% | 5.88% | 17 |
| 180-240 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 240+ | -81.54% | -75.30% | 37.50% | 8 |

**Peak Alpha:** 60-90 (61.08%)
**Stale Exit Point:** 0-30

## 2. Stealth Flow Effectiveness

**Target:** 100% win rate for Low Magnitude Flow (flow_conv < 0.3)

| Metric | Stealth Flow | Other Flow | Advantage |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Trades | 2085 | 417 | - |
| Win Rate | 0.10% | 3.60% | -3.50pp |
| Avg P&L % | -0.37% | -4.94% | +4.57pp |

**Meets Target (100% win rate):** ❌ NO

## 3. Temporal Liquidity Gate Impact

**Gate Threshold:** 50.0 bps
**Trades Blocked:** 0
**Executed Trades (Liquidity Stats):**
- Sample Count: 0
- Avg Spread: 0.00 bps
- Avg P&L: 0.00%
- Win Rate: 0.00%

## 4. Greeks Decay Analysis (CEX/VEX)

**Gamma-Related Trades:** 2494
**Avg P&L:** -1.00%
**Avg Hold Time:** 5.6 minutes

*Note:* Full CEX/VEX analysis requires integration with structural_intelligence.structural_exit module

## 5. Capacity Efficiency

**Displacement Successful:** 0
**Displacement Failed:** 0
**Max Positions Blocked:** 4728
**Total Trades Saved by Displacement:** 0
**Capacity Efficiency:** 0.00%

**Analysis:** Displacement saved 0 trades that would have been blocked by capacity limits

---

## 6. Opportunity Cost Analysis

**High-Score Blocked Trades (>= 5.0):** 0
**Avg Score (Blocked):** 0.00
**Avg P&L (Executed):** -1.13%

**Blocking Reasons (High-Score):**


*Note:* Full opportunity cost requires counterfactual price simulation (see counterfactual_analyzer.py)

## Recommendations

Based on this week's analysis:

1. **Alpha Decay:** Peak alpha at 60-90 - consider tightening exits

2. **Stealth Flow:** ❌ Not meeting target (0.10%) - review boost logic

3. **Liquidity Gate:** No liquidity blocks - gate threshold appropriate

4. **Capacity:** No displacement activity - capacity not constrained
