# Stock Signal Contribution & Intelligence Gap Audit

**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Generated:** 2026-01-30T22:51:02.875886+00:00

## Intent & governance citations

- **§4 Signal Integrity Contract:** preserve signal_type, metadata; no "unknown" unless truly unknown.
- **§7.2 Composite v2 scoring:** formula components (flow, dp, insider, iv_skew, smile, whale, event, motif, toxicity, regime, congress, shorts, inst, tide, calendar, greeks, ftd, iv_rank, oi, etf, squeeze).
- **§7.5–§7.7 Adaptive weights & telemetry:** state/signal_weights.json (0.25x–2.5x); state/score_telemetry.json (component zero%, missing intel).
- **§7.9 Attribution invariants:** append-only logs; attribution MUST NEVER raise inside scoring.
- **Observability-only:** NO tuning, NO gating changes. This report does not modify live behavior.

## Contribution & redundancy findings

### Over-represented, low marginal contribution

- None identified.

### Under-represented, high marginal contribution

- None identified.

### Redundancy (correlation)

- Full correlation matrix requires per-trade component vectors; deferred to offline analysis.
- Signals that frequently co-occur with >80% overlap: check flow + dark_pool, iv_skew + smile.

### Failure modes

- **Signals frequently present in losing trades:** None flagged.
- **Signals absent in winning trades:** flow, dark_pool, insider, iv_skew, smile, whale, event, motif_bonus, toxicity_penalty, regime, congress, shorts_squeeze, institutional, market_tide, calendar

## Intelligence gap taxonomy

| Gap type | Description | Count |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| DATA_GAP | Intel not collected | 22 components <20% coverage |
| SIGNAL_GAP | Feature exists but unused | See over-represented low-contrib |
| TAXONOMY_GAP | Signal too coarse | Manual review |
| REGIME_GAP | No regime-specific intel | 1 regimes |

## Evidence-based roadmap (NO-APPLY)

### 1. Signals to REVIEW (low contribution / high redundancy)

- None.

### 2. Signals to DEEPEN (taxonomy or metadata expansion)

- None.

### 3. Intelligence to ADD (new data sources justified by gaps)

- **REGIME_GAP**: Regimes ['UNKNOWN'] have low sample counts | Confidence: low | **STATUS: SHADOW — NOT APPLIED**

### 4. Signals to PROTECT (high contribution, low coverage risk)

- None.
