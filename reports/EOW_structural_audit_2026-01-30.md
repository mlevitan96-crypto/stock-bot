## 1. Alpha Decay Curves

P&L evolution over position lifetime to identify optimal hold times:

| Hold Time (min) | Avg P&L % | Median P&L % | Win Rate | Sample Count |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 0-30 | -2.20% | 0.00% | 14.73% | 1996 |
| 30-60 | -1.59% | -2.35% | 47.32% | 112 |
| 60-90 | -25.34% | -13.44% | 39.66% | 58 |
| 90-120 | 13.36% | 11.77% | 57.14% | 21 |
| 120-180 | -17.10% | -20.62% | 45.00% | 40 |
| 180-240 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 240+ | 57.27% | 57.27% | 100.00% | 1 |

**Peak Alpha:** 240+ (57.27%)
**Stale Exit Point:** 0-30

## 2. Stealth Flow Effectiveness

**Target:** 100% win rate for Low Magnitude Flow (flow_conv < 0.3)

| Metric | Stealth Flow | Other Flow | Advantage |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Trades | 38 | 2190 | - |
| Win Rate | 57.89% | 17.31% | +40.59pp |
| Avg P&L % | -2.38% | -2.88% | +0.50pp |

**Meets Target (100% win rate):** ❌ NO

## 3. Temporal Liquidity Gate Impact

**Gate Threshold:** 50.0 bps
**Trades Blocked:** 0
**Executed Trades (Liquidity Stats):**
- Sample Count: 0
- Avg Spread: 0.00 bps
- Avg P&L: 0.00%
- Win Rate: 0.00%

## 4. Greeks Decay Analysis (CEX/VEX)

**Gamma-Related Trades:** 2190
**Avg P&L:** -2.88%
**Avg Hold Time:** 9.2 minutes

*Note:* Full CEX/VEX analysis requires integration with structural_intelligence.structural_exit module

---

## 5. Capacity Efficiency

**Displacement Successful:** 0
**Displacement Failed:** 0
**Max Positions Blocked:** 1014
**Total Trades Saved by Displacement:** 0
**Capacity Efficiency:** 0.00%

**Analysis:** Displacement saved 0 trades that would have been blocked by capacity limits

---

## 6. Opportunity Cost Analysis

**High-Score Blocked Trades (>= 5.0):** 483
**Avg Score (Blocked):** 5.29
**Avg P&L (Executed):** -2.87%

**Blocking Reasons (High-Score):**

- max_new_positions_per_cycle: 22
- displacement_blocked: 458
- order_validation_failed: 3

*Note:* Full opportunity cost requires counterfactual price simulation (see counterfactual_analyzer.py)

## Recommendations

Based on this week's analysis:

1. **Alpha Decay:** Peak alpha at 240+ - consider tightening exits

2. **Stealth Flow:** ❌ Not meeting target (57.89%) - review boost logic

3. **Liquidity Gate:** No liquidity blocks - gate threshold appropriate

4. **Capacity:** No displacement activity - capacity not constrained
