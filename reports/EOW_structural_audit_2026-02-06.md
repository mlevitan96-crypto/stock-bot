## 1. Alpha Decay Curves

P&L evolution over position lifetime to identify optimal hold times:

| Hold Time (min) | Avg P&L % | Median P&L % | Win Rate | Sample Count |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 0-30 | -0.34% | 0.00% | 17.96% | 1932 |
| 30-60 | 11.83% | 12.38% | 62.63% | 99 |
| 60-90 | -0.23% | -11.10% | 45.45% | 33 |
| 90-120 | -8.53% | -35.05% | 33.33% | 9 |
| 120-180 | 23.20% | 32.42% | 61.90% | 42 |
| 180-240 | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |
| 240+ | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0 |

**Peak Alpha:** 120-180 (23.20%)
**Stale Exit Point:** 0-30

## 2. Stealth Flow Effectiveness

**Target:** 100% win rate for Low Magnitude Flow (flow_conv < 0.3)

| Metric | Stealth Flow | Other Flow | Advantage |
|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Trades | 56 | 2059 | - |
| Win Rate | 69.64% | 20.11% | +49.54pp |
| Avg P&L % | 41.89% | -0.46% | +42.35pp |

**Meets Target (100% win rate):** ❌ NO

## 3. Temporal Liquidity Gate Impact

**Gate Threshold:** 50.0 bps
**Trades Blocked:** 0
**Executed Trades (Liquidity Stats):**
- Sample Count: 0
- Avg Spread: 0.00 bps
- Avg P&L: 0.00%
- Win Rate: 0.00%

## 4. Greeks Decay Analysis (CEX/VEX)

**Gamma-Related Trades:** 2059
**Avg P&L:** -0.46%
**Avg Hold Time:** 6.8 minutes

*Note:* Full CEX/VEX analysis requires integration with structural_intelligence.structural_exit module

## 5. Capacity Efficiency

**Displacement Successful:** 0
**Displacement Failed:** 0
**Max Positions Blocked:** 1012
**Total Trades Saved by Displacement:** 0
**Capacity Efficiency:** 0.00%

**Analysis:** Displacement saved 0 trades that would have been blocked by capacity limits

---

## 6. Opportunity Cost Analysis

**High-Score Blocked Trades (>= 5.0):** 2000
**Avg Score (Blocked):** 7.91
**Avg P&L (Executed):** 0.66%

**Blocking Reasons (High-Score):**

- displacement_blocked: 1417
- order_validation_failed: 28
- max_positions_reached: 434
- max_new_positions_per_cycle: 121

*Note:* Full opportunity cost requires counterfactual price simulation (see counterfactual_analyzer.py)

## Recommendations

Based on this week's analysis:

1. **Alpha Decay:** Peak alpha at 120-180 - consider tightening exits

2. **Stealth Flow:** ❌ Not meeting target (69.64%) - review boost logic

3. **Liquidity Gate:** No liquidity blocks - gate threshold appropriate

4. **Capacity:** No displacement activity - capacity not constrained
