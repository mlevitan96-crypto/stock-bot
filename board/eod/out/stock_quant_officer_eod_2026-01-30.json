Key issues include a significant number of 'unknown' exit reasons in attribution and a high count of blocked trades, primarily due to displacement and maximum positions being reached.",

This data gap is critical and hinders comprehensive analysis of trade outcomes and driver attribution.

      "body": "Both 'signal_decay' and 'displaced_by_...' are frequently observed as exit reasons, while 'displacement_blocked' and 'max_positions_reached' account for a large portion of blocked trades. This suggests potential inefficiencies in signal management, a high rate of signal replacement, or possibly missed opportunities due to overly restrictive position limits. Further analysis into the profitability of these exits and the opportunity cost of blocked trades is recommended."
