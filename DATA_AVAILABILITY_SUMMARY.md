# Data Availability Summary

## Current Status

**Date Range:** December 15-22, 2025 (7 days)  
**Total Records:** 276  
**Closed Trades:** 124 (analyzable)  
**Open Positions:** 152 (will become analyzable when they close)

## Trading Activity

- **Average Closed Trades per Day:** 20.7
- **Trading Days with Data:** 6 days
- **Current Rate:** Excellent (20+ trades/day is very active)

## Statistical Significance Requirements

- **Minimum for Basic Analysis:** 30 trades ✅ (we have 124)
- **Minimum for Reliable Patterns:** 200 trades ⚠️ (need 76 more)
- **Ideal for Statistical Significance:** 375 trades ⚠️ (need 251 more)

## Timeline to Reach Statistical Significance

At current rate of 20.7 closed trades/day:
- **200 trades:** ~4 more days (Dec 26)
- **375 trades:** ~12 more days (Jan 3, 2026)

## Why We Can't "Pull More" Data

1. **We're using all available data** - The bot logs everything it generates
2. **152 positions are still open** - They'll become analyzable when they close
3. **No historical data before Dec 15** - Bot wasn't logging before then
4. **We need closed trades** - Can't analyze open positions (don't know final P&L)

## What This Means

### ✅ Good News:
- Trading actively (20.7 trades/day is excellent)
- Data quality is good (no missing timestamps, no duplicates)
- On track to reach statistical significance soon (12 days)

### ⚠️ Reality Check:
- **Can't analyze open positions** - We don't know their final P&L yet
- **Can't "pull more" data** - We're using everything that exists
- **Need to wait** - For positions to close and accumulate more data

### 🎯 Recommendations:

1. **Continue Trading** - Current rate is excellent, keep it up
2. **Wait for More Data** - Don't adjust weights until 200+ closed trades
3. **Monitor Daily Close Rate** - Ensure we maintain 15-20 closed trades/day
4. **Use Causal Analysis** - Understand WHY patterns exist, not just WHAT they are
5. **Be Patient** - Statistical significance requires sufficient sample size

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term (4 days):** Reach 200 closed trades for basic reliability
2. **Medium-term (12 days):** Reach 375 closed trades for full statistical significance
3. **Long-term:** Continue accumulating data for even more reliable patterns

## Key Insight

**We're doing everything right** - we just need more time for positions to close and accumulate data. At 20.7 trades/day, we'll have statistically significant data in ~12 days.

The system is working as designed - we're actively trading, logging everything, and accumulating data. We just need patience for the sample size to grow.
